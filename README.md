Playing with GoLang and Vue JS


This is a demo application developed using GoLang for backend.

1. Install GoLang 1.9+.
2. Download the project.
3. Go to the folder and open terminal/command prompt etc.
4. Type "go run main.go".

## Tips: 
- Check port number in main.go file. The port number is in the main function.

```go
func main() {
   ...
   ng.Run(":8080")
   ...
}
```
- Still don't work, create issue.
